It is a fairly simple and efficient script that works by renaming a single empty text file and commiting the changes. Feel free to test it for yourself.

## Requirements:
- Windows Commandline
- Python3


## How To Install:
To run the script type the following commands in CMD:
```
git clone https://github.com/devanshds/Git-commit-bot.git
```
```
cd Git-commit-bot
```
```
python commitbot.py
```
The script will be executed.

## Usage:
  The script needs two parameters to run correctly: Repository name & Repository URL
  - Create an empty repository beforehand without README.md .
  - Make sure the repository name is the same as the empty repository you created before running the script.
  - You may be asked for username and password.
  - And within minutes you will have more commits than you had before.
  
  The repository will come out looking like this so might wanna make it private

##  Notes:
  - I made this purely for learning purposes and out of curiosity. 
  - You can extend its functionality to linux if you have experience with shell.
  - For the curious souls, I myself, am not using this.
